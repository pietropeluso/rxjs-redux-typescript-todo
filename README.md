# Todo application using TypeScript, Redux and RxJs

I've written this application to start getting familiar with these three technologies, getting the idea from the nice tutorial by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) on Egghead.io ([here](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)).

### Installation steps

```
1. clone the repository
2. npm install
3. tsd install
4. npm run build
5. open the build/index.html file
```
